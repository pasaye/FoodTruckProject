# FoodTruckProject

#Overview
This project is to allow a user to input up to five food trucks to rate. Then based on menu option cycle
through and choose options. 1. List all inputed trucks. 2.See the average rating of all trucks. 3. See
their highest rated truck. After which the user can exit and enter new trucks if they so choose. 

##Technologies
 - Java: OOP

##Lesson Learned

Bugs: Bugs, bugs, bugs, so many bugs. There will always be bugs, but its important not to let them overwhelm
you and to take the program one bug at a time. Fix one bug then move to the next, which is fine as long as
you're not crunch for time.

Help: I'm a pretty capable guy. I can count on one finger(hyperbolic of course) the amount of new things I've 
learned that I was't able to grasp within a few short days(Coding). I say this not to brag, but to really drive 
home how unfamiliar asking for help is to me. I thought I was going to move through coding the same way, but I was
very wrong. By the end of the second week I felt really good about OOP, arrays, and everything we learned. However
Starting the second weeks homework, I was obviously very wrong. I struggle with even with everything I thought I knew
and had a really hard time considering ask for help, but ultimately I forced myself to go to TA hours and I didn't regret 
it and will never hesitate again. It was far easier to see my mistaken when someone is explaining to me how I made them.
Asking for help is ... helpful.

For Loops: I get it now. Working with the average section of the program I knew we weren't allowed to use array.length
for division but I didn't know why until I tried and that was the easy part. It took me hours to figure out how to divide
the sum of FoodTruck by the actual iteration of the loop. I figure out I needed to use the iteration pretty quickly, but I
struggle with counting the iterations until I realized I was over thinking the process. At least now I have a good understanding 
of how what a for loop is doing.
